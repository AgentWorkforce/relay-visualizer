# Mission

Create a modern interactive webapp that visualizes how the Agent Relay system works. The webapp should include:

1. **Architecture Overview Page**: Interactive diagram showing the Agent Relay components (Daemon, SDK, MCP server, CLI) and how they connect

2. **Message Flow Visualization**: Animated step-by-step diagram showing how messages flow from one agent to another through the relay daemon

3. **Multi-Agent Demo Page**: Interactive simulation showing multiple agents communicating in real-time with visible message passing

4. **Code Examples Section**: Syntax-highlighted code examples showing how to use the SDK

5. **Live Dashboard Integration**: Embed or link to the relay dashboard at localhost:3888

Use React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations.
