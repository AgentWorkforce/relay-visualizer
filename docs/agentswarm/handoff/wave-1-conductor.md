## Rationale
All 8 backlog tasks are complete with detailed reports. Verification passed: TypeScript compiles without errors, ESLint passes, and production build succeeds (150KB gzipped, well under 500KB target). All 5 required pages are implemented with proper animations, responsive design, and accessibility improvements. Minor npm install issue was resolved during verification - not a code defect.
