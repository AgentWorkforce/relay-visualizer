# T-006: Build Code Examples Page with Syntax Highlighting

## Summary

Built a comprehensive Code Examples page for the Agent Relay visualizer webapp featuring syntax-highlighted TypeScript code examples demonstrating SDK usage.

## What Changed

### New Files Created

1. **`src/components/code/CodeBlock.tsx`**
   - Reusable syntax highlighting component using prism-react-renderer
   - Integrated Night Owl theme for dark mode consistency
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality with animated feedback
   - Line numbers displayed alongside code
   - Mac-style window header with filename display

2. **`src/components/code/CodeTabs.tsx`**
   - Tab interface for switching between code examples
   - Animated tab indicator using Framer Motion
   - Smooth transitions between examples

3. **`src/components/code/index.ts`**
   - Barrel exports for code components

4. **`src/data/codeExamples.ts`**
   - Contains 5 comprehensive SDK usage examples:
     - **Initialization**: Basic setup and connection to relay daemon
     - **Send Message**: Direct messaging with acknowledgment support
     - **Receive Message**: Message handlers and event listeners
     - **Broadcast**: Broadcasting to all agents with filtering
     - **Channels**: Channel subscription and topic-based messaging

### Modified Files

1. **`src/pages/CodeExamplesPage.tsx`**
   - Complete redesign with CodeTabs integration
   - Quick links showing available examples
   - Installation instructions panel
   - Feature cards highlighting SDK capabilities
   - Framer Motion entrance animations

### Dependencies Added

- `prism-react-renderer` - Syntax highlighting library

## Why

The Code Examples page needed to:
- Showcase SDK usage patterns with proper syntax highlighting
- Provide easy code copying for developers
- Offer a clean, navigable interface for browsing multiple examples
- Maintain visual consistency with the app's dark theme

## How to Verify

1. Run type checking:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

2. Run linting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. Start dev server and navigate to /code-examples:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:5173/code-examples

4. Verify:
   - Syntax highlighting renders correctly with Night Owl theme
   - Click copy button, paste elsewhere - code should be copied
   - Click each tab (Initialization, Send Message, Receive Message, Broadcast, Channels)
   - Verify each tab shows different example code
   - Check that animations work smoothly

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| prism-react-renderer installed and configured | Done |
| CodeBlock component renders syntax-highlighted TypeScript code | Done |
| Copy button copies code to clipboard with feedback toast | Done |
| Tab interface to switch between 4-5 examples | Done (5 examples) |
| Examples cover: initialization, send message, receive message, broadcast, channels | Done |
| Code examples are accurate representations of SDK usage | Done |
| Dark theme consistent with app design | Done |

## Follow-ups / Risks

- None identified. All acceptance criteria met.
