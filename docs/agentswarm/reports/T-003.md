# Task T-003: Build Architecture Overview Page

## Summary

Implemented the Architecture Overview page that visualizes the Agent Relay system components with an interactive diagram showing how they connect.

## What Changed

### File Modified

- `src/pages/ArchitecturePage.tsx` - Complete rewrite from placeholder to full implementation

### Features Implemented

1. **Interactive Component Nodes (4 nodes)**
   - Relay Daemon (center, primary/blue variant)
   - Agent SDK (left, secondary/purple variant)
   - MCP Server (right, accent/emerald variant)
   - CLI Tool (bottom, default/slate variant)

2. **Connection Lines**
   - SDK ↔ Daemon: Purple animated bidirectional line (messages)
   - MCP ↔ Daemon: Emerald animated bidirectional line (MCP tools)
   - CLI ↔ Daemon: Slate animated bidirectional line (commands)

3. **Click Interaction**
   - Clicking any node opens a modal with:
     - Component name and description
     - List of key features
     - Color-coded styling matching the node variant

4. **Legend Component**
   - Explains what each node color represents
   - Shows connection line style meaning

5. **Additional Info Panels**
   - "How It Works" section explaining the architecture
   - "Interaction" section guiding users on how to use the diagram

6. **Responsive Layout**
   - Uses CSS Grid (1 column mobile, 4 columns desktop)
   - Container resizes dynamically
   - Node positions calculated based on container size
   - Min/max constraints ensure usability on tablet+ sizes

## Why

The Architecture Overview page is a key part of the Agent Relay Visualizer webapp. It helps users understand:
- What components make up the Agent Relay system
- How they relate to each other
- What each component's role and features are

The interactive design makes it engaging and educational.

## How to Verify

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/architecture` in the browser

3. Verify:
   - All 4 component nodes render (Daemon center, SDK left, MCP right, CLI bottom)
   - Animated connection lines are visible between each peripheral node and Daemon
   - Clicking each node opens a modal with component information
   - Legend is visible on the right sidebar
   - Resizing the browser window adjusts the layout responsively

4. Run verification commands:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check  # Should pass with no errors
   npm run lint        # Should pass with no errors
   ```

## Technical Notes

- Uses existing reusable components from `src/components/diagrams/`:
  - `ComponentNode` - For rendering the 4 nodes
  - `ConnectionLine` - For drawing animated connections
- Uses Framer Motion for modal animations
- Positions are calculated dynamically using `useRef` and `useEffect` for responsive behavior
- All TypeScript types are properly defined

## Follow-ups / Risks

- None identified. The page is self-contained and uses existing infrastructure.
