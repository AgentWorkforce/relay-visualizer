# Task T-001 Completion Report

## Task: Set up routing, layout, and navigation

### Summary
Configured React Router with routes for all 6 pages (including home), utilizing the Layout and Navigation components with proper barrel exports.

### What Changed

#### Files Modified
- **src/App.tsx**: BrowserRouter setup with all routes wrapped in Layout component

#### Files Included (synced with project structure)
- **src/pages/HomePage.tsx**: Home page with overview cards
- **src/pages/ArchitecturePage.tsx**: Architecture overview page placeholder
- **src/pages/MessageFlowPage.tsx**: Message flow visualization page placeholder
- **src/pages/MultiAgentDemoPage.tsx**: Multi-agent demo page placeholder
- **src/pages/CodeExamplesPage.tsx**: Code examples page placeholder
- **src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx**: Dashboard page placeholder
- **src/pages/index.ts**: Barrel export for all page components
- **src/components/layout/index.ts**: Barrel export for Layout and Navigation

#### Layout Components
- **src/components/layout/Layout.tsx**: Component with slate-900 background, Navigation, and Outlet
- **src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx**: NavLink-based navigation with active state highlighting

### Why

The routing and navigation infrastructure was needed as the foundation for the Agent Relay Visualizer webapp. This allows:
1. Users to navigate between the 6 main sections of the application
2. Consistent layout and styling across all pages
3. Visual indication of the currently active route
4. Clean URL structure matching the acceptance criteria

### Routes Implemented

| Path | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | HomePage | Landing page with section overview |
| `/architecture` | ArchitecturePage | Architecture diagram placeholder |
| `/message-flow` | MessageFlowPage | Message flow animation placeholder |
| `/multi-agent` | MultiAgentDemoPage | Multi-agent simulation placeholder |
| `/code-examples` | CodeExamplesPage | SDK code examples placeholder |
| `/dashboard` | DashboardPage | Live dashboard embed placeholder |

### How to Verify

1. **TypeScript compilation**:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```
   Expected: No errors

2. **Linting**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Expected: No errors

3. **Development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Expected: Opens at http://localhost:5173

4. **Manual testing**:
   - Open browser to http://localhost:5173
   - Click each navigation link
   - Verify URL changes to corresponding path
   - Verify active route is highlighted with blue background
   - Verify no console errors

5. **Production build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Expected: Builds successfully

### Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Routes defined for /, /architecture, /message-flow, /multi-agent, /code-examples, /dashboard | Done |
| Navigation component renders links to all routes | Done |
| Layout component wraps page content with consistent padding/margins | Done |
| Active route is visually highlighted in nav | Done |
| TypeScript compiles without errors | Done |

### Follow-ups

- Other workers will implement the actual content for each page (Architecture diagrams, Message Flow animations, Multi-Agent demo, Code Examples, Dashboard integration)

### Risks

- None identified. The implementation follows standard React Router patterns and the project naming conventions.
